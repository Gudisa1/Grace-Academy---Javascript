0) Quick idea: what “position” does

The position property controls how an element is placed in the page and which box it uses as its reference when you nudge it with top, right, bottom, left (or the shorthand inset).

Values you’ll use most:

static (default — no offsets)

relative (stays in flow; offsets nudge it)

absolute (removed from flow; positioned relative to a positioned ancestor)

fixed (stuck to the viewport)

sticky (acts static, then sticks when scrolled to a threshold)
