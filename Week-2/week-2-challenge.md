# Week-2 Challenge
### **Challenge 1: Student Grades Analysis**

**Scenario:** You have an array of student objects with their names and scores in different subjects. You need to calculate the average score for each student and create a summary report.

**Tasks:**

1. Use **objects** to store student data.
2. Use **object keys, values, and entries** to access and manipulate scores.
3. Use **destructuring assignment** to extract student name and scores.
4. Write a **function** (or **arrow function**) to calculate average score.
5. Use a **loop** to iterate through all students.
6. Use **spread operator** to create a new object with additional information (e.g., add `passed: true/false` based on average).
7. Use **map, filter, and reduce** methods to:

   * `map` over students to compute averages.
   * `filter` students who passed.
   * `reduce` to calculate class average.
8. Optional: Use **rest operator** to handle an unknown number of scores per student.

### **Challenge 2: Shopping Cart System**

**Scenario:** You are building a shopping cart. Each item has a name, price, and category. You want to analyze the cart and apply discounts.

**Tasks:**

1. Store items as **objects** inside an array.
2. Use **destructuring assignment** to extract name, price, and category.
3. Write a **function** (or **arrow function**) to apply a discount to each item.
4. Use **spread operator** to create a new cart with discounted prices without modifying the original cart.
5. Use **rest operator** in a function to calculate the total cost of any number of items.
6. Use **loops** or **map** to display all items in the cart.
7. Use **filter** to get all items in a specific category.
8. Use **reduce** to calculate the total price after discount.

### **Challenge 3: Employee Directory Search**

**Scenario:** You have an array of employee objects. Each employee has a name, department, and skills (array). You want to create a searchable summary.

**Tasks:**

1. Use **objects** to represent employees.
2. Use **object keys, values, and entries** to extract employee information.
3. Use **destructuring assignment** to get the employeeâ€™s name, department, and skills.
4. Write a **function** (or **arrow function**) to check if an employee has a certain skill.
5. Use **loops** or **map** to display employees and their details.
6. Use **spread operator** to add new skills to an employee without modifying the original object.
7. Use **rest operator** in a function to search for multiple skills at once.
8. Use **filter** to find employees in a specific department.
9. Use **reduce** to get a list of all unique skills in the company.
