#  JavaScript Rest Operator (`...`)  
You’ve probably seen three dots (`...`) in JavaScript.

* Sometimes it’s called **Spread** (when it *expands things*).
* Sometimes it’s called **Rest** (when it *collects things*).

This lesson is about the **Rest Operator**.

## 🔎 What Does Rest Do?

The **Rest Operator** (`...`) takes the **remaining values** and puts them into a **single array (or object)**.

👉 Think of it like a basket 🧺:

* You take the leftover apples and put them in one basket.

## ✨ Easy Examples of Rest

### 1. Rest in Functions

Imagine you want a function that adds numbers, but you don’t know how many numbers people will give.

```js
function addNumbers(...nums) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let n of nums) {
    total += n;  // add each number
  }
  return total;
}

console.log(addNumbers(2, 4));        // 6
console.log(addNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4));  // 10
```

✅ `...nums` collects all the arguments into an array like `[1,2,3,4]`.
Then we loop through and add them.

---

### 2. Rest with Arrays

You can use rest when **breaking arrays apart**.

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange"];

const [first, second, ...others] = fruits;

console.log(first);   // apple
console.log(second);  // banana
console.log(others);  // ["mango", "orange"]
```

✅ The first two values go into `first` and `second`.
✅ The rest operator gathers the leftover items into `others`.

---

### 3. Rest with Objects

Rest can also collect leftover properties from objects.

```js
const student = { name: "Sara", age: 20, grade: "A", course: "Math" };

const { name, ...details } = student;

console.log(name);    // Sara
console.log(details); // { age: 20, grade: "A", course: "Math" }
```

✅ We took out `name`.
✅ The rest (`age`, `grade`, `course`) goes into `details`.

---

## ⚠️ Rules to Remember

1. **Rest must be last** in function parameters:

```js
function showInfo(first, ...rest) {
  console.log(first);  // first value
  console.log(rest);   // all other values
}

showInfo("A", "B", "C", "D");
// first = "A"
// rest = ["B", "C", "D"]
```

2. **Only one rest operator** is allowed in a function.

---

## 📝 Recap

* Rest (`...`) **packs** values together into an array or object.
* Use it when:

  * You don’t know how many arguments a function will get.
  * You want to grab leftover items in arrays or objects.
* Rule: Rest must be the **last** one in a function’s parameter list.
