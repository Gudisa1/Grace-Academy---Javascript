## What is a Function?

A **function** is a block of code that does a particular job when you call it. Think of it like a small machine: you switch it on (call it), and it does its work.

### How to Create a Function

In JavaScript, you create a function using the `function` keyword, followed by the function's name and parentheses:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

Here:

* `function` — tells JavaScript you’re making a function.
* `greet` — the name of the function.
* `{ ... }` — the body of the function where your code goes.

### Calling a Function

Just creating a function doesn’t run it. To make the function work, you need to **call** it by writing its name followed by parentheses:

```javascript
greet();  // Output: Hello World!
```

When you call `greet()`, it runs the code inside the function and prints "Hello World!" to the screen.

## Function Expressions: Functions Stored in Variables

Functions in JavaScript can also be stored inside variables. This is called a **function expression**. Here’s an example:

```javascript
let displayPI = function() {
    console.log("PI = 3.14");
};

displayPI();  // Output: PI = 3.14
```

Here, the function has no name and is assigned to the variable `displayPI`. You call it by using the variable name with parentheses.

## Functions with Arguments: Making Functions More Flexible

Functions can take **arguments**, which are values you give to the function to work with.

### Example: Greeting Someone by Name

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}

greet("John");  // Output: Hello John
greet("David"); // Output: Hello David
```

In this example:

* `name` is a **parameter** — a placeholder inside the function.
* `"John"` and `"David"` are **arguments** — actual values passed to the function when calling it.

### Multiple Arguments

You can also create functions that take multiple arguments:

```javascript
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
    let sum = num1 + num2;
    console.log(`Sum: ${sum}`);
}

addNumbers(5, 4);  // Output: Sum: 9
```

Here, `num1` and `num2` receive the numbers you pass and then add them together.

---

## Returning Values from Functions

Functions can return a value back to where they were called using the `return` statement.

### Example: Find the Square of a Number

```javascript
function findSquare(num) {
    return num * num;
}

let square = findSquare(3);
console.log(`Square: ${square}`);  // Output: Square: 9
```

The `findSquare` function calculates the square and sends it back. We store this returned value in `square` and then print it.

**Important:** Once a function hits a `return` statement, it stops running — any code after `return` won't run.

## Useful Built-in JavaScript Functions

JavaScript comes with many built-in functions ready to use. Here are some popular ones:

| Function        | What It Does                        | Example                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `console.log()` | Prints messages to the console      | `console.log("Hello");`           |
| `Math.sqrt()`   | Returns the square root of a number | `Math.sqrt(4);  // 2`             |
| `Math.pow()`    | Raises a number to a power          | `Math.pow(2, 3);  // 8`           |
| `toUpperCase()` | Converts a string to uppercase      | `"hello".toUpperCase(); // HELLO` |
| `toLowerCase()` | Converts a string to lowercase      | `"HELLO".toLowerCase(); // hello` |

### Example Using Built-in Functions

```javascript
let squareRoot = Math.sqrt(4);
console.log("Square Root of 4 is", squareRoot);

let power = Math.pow(2, 3);
console.log("2 to the power of 3 is", power);

let band = "Iron Maiden";
let bandUpper = band.toUpperCase();
console.log(`Favorite Band: ${bandUpper}`);
```

**Output:**

```
Square Root of 4 is 2
2 to the power of 3 is 8
Favorite Band: IRON MAIDEN
```

## Summary

* Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
* Use the `function` keyword to create functions.
* Call functions by writing their name followed by parentheses.
* Functions can take parameters (placeholders) and arguments (actual values).
* Use `return` to send a result back from a function.
* You can store functions inside variables (function expressions).
* JavaScript provides many built-in functions like `Math.sqrt()` and `toUpperCase()`.
