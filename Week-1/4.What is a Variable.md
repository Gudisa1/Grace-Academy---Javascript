## **What is a Variable?**

Imagine a variable as a labeled **box** in your computer's memory. You can put data inside this box, and the label (the variable name) allows you to easily find and access that data whenever you need it.


---


## **Declaring Variables: let**

In modern JavaScript, you use the let keyword to declare a variable. This means you're creating a new "box" and giving it a name.

Here's how you declare a variable named message:

JavaScript

let message;

At this point, the message box exists, but it's empty.


---


## **Assigning Values: The = Operator**

Once you've declared a variable, you can put data into it using the **assignment operator** (=).

JavaScript

let message; // Declare the variable

message = 'Hello'; // Assign the string 'Hello' to the message variable

Now, the string 'Hello' is stored inside the message box.

You can then access the content of the variable using its name:

JavaScript

let message;

message = 'Hello!';

alert(message); // This will display a pop-up with "Hello!"


---


## **Combining Declaration and Assignment**

For conciseness, you can declare a variable and assign its initial value in a single line:

JavaScript

let message = 'Hello!'; // Declare 'message' and assign 'Hello!'

alert(message); // Hello!


---


## **Declaring Multiple Variables**

While technically possible to declare multiple variables on one line, it's generally **not recommended** for readability.


### **Not Recommended (Single Line):**

JavaScript

let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';


### **Recommended (Multiline for Clarity):**

JavaScript

let user = 'John';

let age = 25;

let message = 'Hello';

Some developers might use a multiline style with commas, or a "comma-first" style, but the goal remains clarity:

JavaScript

// Multiline with commas

let user = 'John',

  age = 25,

  message = 'Hello';

// Comma-first style

let user = 'John'

  , age = 25

  , message = 'Hello';

All these methods achieve the same result, so the choice often comes down to personal or team preference for code aesthetics.


---


## **var vs. let (A Quick Note)**

In older JavaScript code, you might encounter the var keyword instead of let:

JavaScript

var message = 'Hello';

The var keyword also declares a variable but has some subtle differences from let. For now, just know that let is the modern and preferred way to declare variables. You'll learn more about var later if needed.


---


## **Changing Variable Values**

The power of variables lies in their flexibility. You can change the value stored in a variable as many times as you want.

JavaScript

let message;

message = 'Hello!'; // First value

alert(message);     // Shows "Hello!"

message = 'World!'; // Value changed

alert(message);     // Shows "World!"

When you assign a new value, the old data is replaced.


---


## **Copying Variable Values**

You can also copy data from one variable to another:

JavaScript

let hello = 'Hello world!';

let message;

// Copy the value from 'hello' into 'message'

message = hello;

alert(hello);   // Shows "Hello world!"

alert(message); // Shows "Hello world!"

Now both hello and message variables hold the same data.


---


## **Declaring Variables Only Once**

A crucial rule in JavaScript is that a variable should be declared only once using let. Attempting to declare the same variable twice will result in an error:

JavaScript

let message = "This";

// This will cause a SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared

let message = "That";

Once a variable is declared with let, you simply refer to it by its name without let for subsequent assignments or uses.


---


## **Variable Naming Rules**

Choosing good variable names is incredibly important for writing readable and maintainable code. Here are the rules for naming variables in JavaScript:



* **Allowed Characters:** Names can contain letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
* **First Character:** The first character must **not** be a digit.
* **CamelCase:** For multi-word names, camelCase is the common convention. The first word starts lowercase, and subsequent words start with a capital letter (e.g., userName, myVeryLongName).
* **Case Sensitive:** JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. apple and APPLE are considered two different variables.


### **Valid Examples:**

JavaScript

let userName;

let test123;

let $ = 1; // Valid, though less common

let _ = 2; // Valid, though less common

alert($ + _); // 3


### **Invalid Examples:**

JavaScript

let 1a;      // Cannot start with a digit

let my-name; // Hyphens '-' are not allowed (they are used for subtraction)


---


## **Reserved Names**

JavaScript has a list of **reserved words** that have special meaning in the language and cannot be used as variable names. Examples include let, class, return, and function.

JavaScript

let let = 5;    // Error: 'let' is a reserved keyword

let return = 5; // Error: 'return' is a reserved keyword


---


## **Constants: const**

To declare a variable whose value should **never change**, you use the const keyword instead of let. Variables declared with const are called **constants**.

JavaScript

const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

Once a const variable is assigned a value, you **cannot reassign** it. Attempting to do so will cause an error:

JavaScript

const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

// This will cause an error: Assignment to constant variable.

myBirthday = '01.01.2001';

Using const is a good practice when you're certain a value won't change, as it helps communicate your intent and prevents accidental modifications.


---


## **Uppercase Constants**

A common practice for constants that are known **before execution** (i.e., "hard-coded" values) is to name them using **capital letters and underscores**. These are often used as aliases for difficult-to-remember values.

For example, defining colors:

JavaScript

const COLOR_RED    = "#F00";

const COLOR_GREEN  = "#0F0";

const COLOR_BLUE   = "#00F";

const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

let color = COLOR_ORANGE; // Use the constant

alert(color);             // Shows "#FF7F00"


### **Benefits of Uppercase Constants:**



* **Memorability:** COLOR_ORANGE is easier to remember than #FF7F00.
* **Reduced Errors:** Less chance of mistyping the complex hexadecimal value.
* **Readability:** COLOR_ORANGE is more meaningful in the code than a raw hexadecimal string.


### **When to Use Uppercase:**

Uppercase constants are typically reserved for values that are fixed and known before the program runs. If a constant's value is calculated during runtime (even if it doesn't change afterward), it's usually named in camelCase.

JavaScript

const pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */; // Not uppercase, as it's calculated at runtime


---


## **Naming Things Right**

Effective variable naming is a cornerstone of good programming. It significantly impacts how understandable and maintainable your code is.


### **Good Practices for Naming:**



* **Human-Readable:** Use names that clearly describe the data they hold, like userName or shoppingCart.
* **Avoid Abbreviations:** Steer clear of vague single-letter names like a, b, or c unless their context is extremely clear.
* **Descriptive and Concise:** Names like data or value are often too generic. Be as specific as possible.
* **Consistent Terminology:** If your team calls a website visitor a "user," stick to currentUser or newUser rather than currentVisitor.

Taking the time to choose good variable names pays off immensely in the long run, especially when you or others need to revisit or extend the code.

## **Reuse or Create? (The "Extra Variable" Debate)**

While it might seem efficient to reuse existing variables for different purposes, this often leads to **confusing and hard-to-debug code**. It's like constantly changing the contents of a box without updating its label.

**It's better to create a new variable for each distinct piece of information.** Modern JavaScript engines and minifiers are highly optimized, so creating a few extra variables generally won't cause performance issues. In fact, it can even help the engine optimize your code.

An extra variable is good, not evil!


---


## **Summary of Variable Declaration Keywords**



* **let**: The modern way to declare a variable whose value can be reassigned.
* **var**: An older way to declare variables. While still functional, let is preferred due to its clearer behavior.
* **const**: Declares a constant variable whose value cannot be changed after its initial assignment.

Variables are fundamental to JavaScript programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data effectively. By understanding their purpose, proper declaration, and naming conventions, you'll write cleaner, more understandable, and more maintainable code.

## **Tasks**


### **Working with Variables**



1. Declare two variables: admin and name.
2. Assign the value "John" to name.
3. Copy the value from name to admin.
4. Show the value of admin using alert (it should output "John").


### **Giving the Right Name**



1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
2. Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?


### **Uppercase const?**

Examine the following code:

JavaScript

const birthday = '18.04.1982';

const age = someCode(birthday);

Here we have a constant birthday for the date, and also the age constant. The age is calculated from birthday using someCode().

Would it be right to use uppercase for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

JavaScript

const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?

const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?
