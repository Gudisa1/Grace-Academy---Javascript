# **User Interaction in JavaScript: alert, prompt, and confirm**

When developing web applications, you often need to interact with the user, perhaps to display information, ask a question, or get input. JavaScript provides several built-in browser-specific functions for this purpose: alert, prompt, and confirm. These functions create simple, modal dialog boxes that pause script execution until the user responds.

## **1. alert**

The alert function is the simplest of the three. It displays a message to the user and waits for them to press the "OK" button.


### **Syntax:**

JavaScript

alert(message);



* message: The text string you want to display in the alert box.


### **Example:**

JavaScript

alert("Hello, welcome to our site!");


### **How alert Works:**

When alert("Hello"); is executed, a small, mini-window (often called a **modal window**) appears in the browser.

Code snippet

    A[User's Web Page] --> B{Browser Modal Window};

    B -- "Displays 'Hello'" --> C[OK Button];

    C -- "User Clicks OK" --> A;



* **Modal Window:** The term "modal" is crucial here. It means that while this alert window is open, the user **cannot interact with any other part of the web page**. They cannot click on other buttons, scroll, or type into form fields until they close the alert box by clicking "OK".
* **Purpose:** alert is typically used for displaying important, non-critical information that the user simply needs to acknowledge.

## **2. prompt**

The prompt function is used when you need to get textual input from the user. It displays a modal window with a message, an input field for the user to type in, and "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.


### **Syntax:**

JavaScript

result = prompt(title, [default]);



* title: (Required) The text message displayed to the user in the prompt window.
* default: (Optional, indicated by []) An initial, default value that will appear in the input field. If the user doesn't type anything and just presses "OK", this default value will be returned.


### **How prompt Works:**

When prompt is called, a modal window appears.

Code snippet

graph TD

    A[User's Web Page] --> B{Browser Modal Window};

    B -- "Displays 'How old are you?'" --> C[Input Field];

    C -- "Initial Value (e.g., 100)" --> C;

    C -- "User Types/Leaves Value" --> D(OK / Cancel Buttons);

    D -- "User Clicks OK" --> E[Returns Text from Input];

    D -- "User Clicks Cancel or Esc" --> F[Returns null];

    E --> A;

    F --> A;



* **User Input:** The user can type text into the input field.
* **Return Value:**
    * If the user types something and clicks "OK", the prompt function returns that text as a **string**.
    * If the user clicks "Cancel" or presses the Esc key, the prompt function returns null.


### **Example:**

JavaScript

let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100); // Default value is 100

alert(`You are ${age} years old!`); // If user enters 25, outputs "You are 25 years old!"

                                  // If user presses OK with default, outputs "You are 100 years old!"

                                  // If user presses Cancel, outputs "You are null years old!"


### **Important Note for Internet Explorer (IE):**

While the default parameter is technically optional, it's highly recommended to always provide it, even if it's an empty string (''), for better cross-browser compatibility, especially with older versions of Internet Explorer. If you omit the default parameter in IE, it might display the text "undefined" in the input field, which is not user-friendly.

JavaScript

// In Internet Explorer without a default, might show "undefined"

let test = prompt("Test");

// Recommended for IE compatibility: always provide a default

let test2 = prompt("Test", ''); // Displays an empty input field

## **3. confirm**

The confirm function is used to ask the user a yes/no question. It displays a modal window with a question and two buttons: "OK" and "Cancel".


### **Syntax:**

JavaScript

result = confirm(question);



* question: The text string representing the question you want to ask the user.


### **How confirm Works:q=**

When confirm is called, a modal window appears.

Code snippet

graph TD

    A[User's Web Page] --> B{Browser Modal Window};

    B -- "Displays 'Are you the boss?'" --> C(OK / Cancel Buttons);

    C -- "User Clicks OK" --> D[Returns true];

    C -- "User Clicks Cancel or Esc" --> E[Returns false];

    D --> A;

    E --> A;



* **Return Value:**
    * If the user clicks "OK", the confirm function returns the boolean value true.
    * If the user clicks "Cancel" or presses the Esc key, the confirm function returns the boolean value false.


### **Example:**

JavaScript

let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?"); // Asks the user "Are you the boss?"

alert( isBoss ); // If OK is pressed, outputs: true

                 // If Cancel is pressed, outputs: false

confirm is typically used within conditional statements (if statements) to control program flow based on user choice.

## **Summary of Interaction Functions**

We've covered three essential browser-specific functions for interacting with users:



* **alert(message)**: Shows a simple message and waits for the user to press "OK".
* **prompt(title, [default])**: Shows a message, an input field, and waits for the user to input text. It returns the entered text (as a string) or null if the input is canceled (by clicking "Cancel" or pressing Esc).
* **confirm(question)**: Shows a message with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, waiting for the user to make a choice. It returns true if "OK" is pressed, and false otherwise (for "Cancel" or Esc).


### **Key Characteristics:**

All three of these methods share a few important characteristics:



1. **Modality**: They are **modal** functions. This means they *pause script execution* and prevent the user from interacting with any other part of the web page until the dialog box is dismissed. Your JavaScript code will literally stop running at the alert, prompt, or confirm line until the user clicks a button.
2. **Browser-Dependent Appearance**: The exact location (usually center) and visual look and feel (styling) of these modal windows are determined entirely by the user's browser and operating system. You **cannot modify their appearance** using JavaScript or CSS. This is the trade-off for their simplicity and ease of use.

For situations where you need highly customized dialog boxes, more advanced techniques involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g., creating custom modals) are required. However, for quick, simple user interactions, alert, prompt, and confirm are perfectly suitable and widely used.

## **Tasks**


### **A Simple Page**

Create a web page (an HTML file with embedded JavaScript) that asks the user for their name and then outputs it back to them.

**Hint:** You'll need to use prompt to get the name and alert to display it.
