# **JavaScript Challenge — Cafe Billing & Loyalty System**

**Scenario:**
You have been hired by **Brew Haven Cafe** to build a small JavaScript program for calculating customer bills.
The system should:

* Store customer and order details
* Handle **different data types** and **type conversions**
* Use **operators** to calculate totals
* Apply **comparisons** and **conditional statements** to decide discounts and rewards

---

## **Your Task**

Write a JavaScript program that:

1. **Declares Variables**

   * Use `const` for values that never change (e.g., cafe name).
   * Use `let` for values that may change (e.g., quantities, total bill).
   * Store at least one `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `null` value.

2. **Type Conversion**

   * Some variables should initially be stored as **strings** but converted to the correct type before calculations.

3. **Calculates the Total Bill**

   * Calculate the total cost based on:

     * Coffee price × coffee quantity
     * Pastry price × pastry quantity
     * Add them together for the total bill before discount.

4. **Applies Discount Rules**

   * If the customer is a **loyalty member** **AND** spends ≥ 100 → 20% discount
   * If the customer is a **loyalty member** but spends < 100 → 10% discount
   * If the customer is **not** a member but spends ≥ 150 → 5% discount
   * Otherwise → No discount

5. **Checks for Special Offer**

   * If the **final bill after discount** is still ≥ 200 → Print **"You get a free cake!"**

6. **Displays the Output**

   * Show: cafe name, customer name, membership status, total before discount, discount applied, final bill, and special offer (if any).

## **Requirements Checklist**

✅ Use `let` and `const` appropriately
✅ Include at least one of each data type: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`
✅ Perform **type conversion** using `Number()` or boolean conversion
✅ Use **arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
✅ Use **comparison operators** (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `===`)
✅ Use **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
✅ Use **conditional statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
