# **Type Conversions in JavaScript**

In JavaScript, data values are always of a certain type (like number or string). While many operators and functions automatically convert values to the correct type for their operations, there are also times when you need to explicitly tell JavaScript to convert a value from one type to another. This process is called **type conversion** (or **type casting**).

## **Automatic vs. Explicit Conversion**


### **âœ… 1. Automatic (Implicit) Type Conversion**

JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another **when needed**, behind the scenes.


    This is called **type coercion** â€” JS is trying to "help" by guessing the correct type.


---


### **ðŸ“Œ Examples (with Explanation):**


#### **ðŸ§® Example 1: String + Number = String**

js

CopyEdit


```
let result = "The score is: " + 10;
alert(result); // â†’ "The score is: 10"
```


**Why?** JS converts the number `10` to a string and joins it.


---


#### **âž— Example 2: String / Number = Number**

js

CopyEdit


```
let result = "100" / 2;
alert(result); // â†’ 50
```


**Why?** JS converts `"100"` (a string) into a number automatically.



* 
* **Explicit Conversion:** This is when you consciously use a function or method to change a value's type. This is crucial when you expect a specific type of data (e.g., a number from a text input field).

**Note:** For this chapter, we are focusing only on **primitive data types** (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, symbol). How objects are converted to primitives is a more advanced topic covered later in "Object to Primitive Conversion."

## **1. String Conversion**

String conversion is the process of changing a value into its string representation.


### **When it happens automatically:**



* When you use alert(value).
* When concatenating values with a string using the + operator (e.g., 10 + " apples" becomes "10 apples").


### **How to perform explicit String Conversion:**

You can use the String(value) function to explicitly convert any value to a string.

JavaScript

let value = true;

alert(typeof value); // Output: boolean

value = String(value); // Now 'value' is explicitly converted to the string "true"

alert(typeof value); // Output: string

alert(value);        // Output: "true"

String conversion is generally straightforward and intuitive for primitive types:



* false becomes "false"
* null becomes "null"
* 123 becomes "123"
* undefined becomes "undefined"


---


## **2. Numeric Conversion**

Numeric conversion is the process of changing a value into a number.


### **When it happens automatically:**



* In most mathematical operations (*, /, -, etc.). The + operator is an exception: if one of the operands is a string, it performs string concatenation rather than numeric addition.
* JavaScript

alert("6" / "2");   // Both "6" and "2" are converted to numbers (6 and 2) -> Result: 3

alert("10" - "5");  // Both "10" and "5" are converted to numbers (10 and 5) -> Result: 5

alert(5 + "5");     // Here, 5 is converted to "5" -> Result: "55" (string concatenation)



* 
* 


### **How to perform explicit Numeric Conversion:**

You can use the Number(value) function to explicitly convert a value to a number. This is often necessary when you receive input as a string (e.g., from a form field) but expect it to be a number.

JavaScript

let str = "123";

alert(typeof str); // Output: string

let num = Number(str); // Explicitly converts "123" to the number 123

alert(typeof num); // Output: number

alert(num);        // Output: 123


### **What if the string isn't a valid number?**

If the string cannot be meaningfully converted into a number, the result of Number(value) will be NaN (Not a Number).

JavaScript

let age = Number("an arbitrary string instead of a number");

alert(age); // Output: NaN (conversion failed)


### **Numeric Conversion Rules Summary:**

Here's a table summarizing how different types are converted to numbers using Number(value):


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Value
   </td>
   <td>Becomes...
   </td>
   <td>Examples
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>undefined
   </td>
   <td>NaN
   </td>
   <td>Number(undefined) is NaN
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>null
   </td>
   <td>0 (Zero)
   </td>
   <td>Number(null) is 0
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>true
   </td>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>Number(true) is 1
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>false
   </td>
   <td>0
   </td>
   <td>Number(false) is 0
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>string
   </td>
   <td>1. Whitespaces (spaces, tabs \t, newlines \n, etc.) from the start and end are removed. &lt;br> 2. If the remaining string is empty, the result is 0. &lt;br> 3. Otherwise, the number is "read" from the string. &lt;br> 4. If the string cannot be parsed as a number, the result is NaN.
   </td>
   <td>Number(" 123 ") is 123 &lt;br> Number("") is 0 &lt;br> Number("123z") is NaN &lt;br> Number(" ") is 0
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>BigInt
   </td>
   <td>The corresponding numeric value, but if outside safe range it loses precision (not typical to convert BigInt to Number directly for large values).
   </td>
   <td>Number(123n) is 123
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Symbol
   </td>
   <td>Throws an error
   </td>
   <td>Number(Symbol('id')) throws TypeError
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Key takeaway:** Notice the distinct behavior of null (becomes 0) versus undefined (becomes NaN). This is a common point of confusion.

## **3. Boolean Conversion**

Boolean conversion is the simplest type of conversion, resulting in either true or false.


### **When it happens automatically:**



* In logical operations (e.g., if conditions, &&, || operators).


### **How to perform explicit Boolean Conversion:**

You can use the Boolean(value) function to explicitly convert any value to a boolean.

JavaScript

alert( Boolean(1) );        // Output: true (any non-zero number is true)

alert( Boolean(0) );        // Output: false (zero is false)

alert( Boolean("hello") );  // Output: true (any non-empty string is true)

alert( Boolean("") );       // Output: false (an empty string is false)


### **Boolean Conversion Rules Summary:**

The rule for boolean conversion is straightforward:



* **"Falsy" Values**: Values that are intuitively "empty" or "nothing" become false.
* **"Truthy" Values**: All other values become true.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
Value
   </td>
   <td>Becomes...
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>0 (the number zero)
   </td>
   <td>false
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>null
   </td>
   <td>false
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>undefined
   </td>
   <td>false
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>NaN
   </td>
   <td>false
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>"" (an empty string)
   </td>
   <td>false
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Any other value (non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, objects, functions, symbols, BigInts other than 0n)
   </td>
   <td>true
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Important Note: "0" and space-only strings are true in JavaScript!

Unlike some other programming languages (like PHP) where the string "0" might be treated as false, in JavaScript, any non-empty string is considered true when converted to a boolean.

JavaScript

alert( Boolean("0") );    // Output: true (it's a non-empty string)

alert( Boolean(" ") );    // Output: true (a string with just spaces is also non-empty)

This is a frequent source of bugs if you assume Boolean("0") would be false.


---


## **Summary**

Understanding type conversions is fundamental to writing correct and predictable JavaScript code.

The three most common type conversions are:



* **String Conversion**:
    * Happens automatically when outputting (e.g., alert()) or concatenating with strings.
    * Explicitly: String(value).
    * Generally intuitive for primitives.
* **Numeric Conversion**:
    * Happens automatically in most mathematical operations.
    * Explicitly: Number(value).
    * Key rules: undefined becomes NaN, null becomes 0, empty string becomes 0, non-numeric string becomes NaN.
* **Boolean Conversion**:
    * Happens automatically in logical operations (e.g., if statements).
    * Explicitly: Boolean(value).
    * **Falsy values**: 0, null, undefined, NaN, "" (empty string).
    * **Truthy values**: All other values (including non-empty strings like "0" and " ").

Most of these rules are straightforward, but pay special attention to the "falsy" values and the specific numeric conversion of null vs. undefined.

We have intentionally excluded object conversions for now. We will revisit how objects convert to primitive types in a later, dedicated chapter ("Object to primitive conversion") once we've covered more foundational JavaScript concepts.

### **String Quotes**

What is the output of the script?

JavaScript

let name = "Ilya";

alert( `hello ${1}` );    // ?

alert( `hello ${"name"}` ); // ?

alert( `hello ${name}` ); // ?
