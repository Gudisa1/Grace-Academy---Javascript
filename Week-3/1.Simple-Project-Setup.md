### 1\. Project Setup

To start, create a new folder for your project and inside it, create three files:

  * `index.html`: This file will contain the structure and content of your webpage.
  * `style.css`: This file will handle the styling and visual presentation.
  * `app.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code for adding dynamic behavior.

### 2\. Connect the Files

Now, let's connect the files together.

#### **HTML and CSS**

To link your CSS file to your HTML document, you'll use a `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file.

**`index.html`**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Connected Files</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>This paragraph will be styled by CSS.</p>

  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **HTML and JavaScript**

To link your JavaScript file, use a `<script>` tag. While you can place it in the `<head>`, the **best practice** is to place it just before the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures that the HTML content is loaded and rendered first, preventing potential errors if your JavaScript tries to manipulate an element that doesn't yet exist in the page.

### 3\. Add Content and Code

Now, let's add some basic content to each file to see the connections in action.

**`style.css`**

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  color: #333;
}

h1 {
  color: steelblue;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**`app.js`**

```javascript
console.log("HTML, CSS, and JS are all connected!");

// Example: Change the paragraph content
const myParagraph = document.querySelector('p');
myParagraph.textContent = "I've been changed by JavaScript!";
```

### 4\. Check in the Browser

To see everything working, simply **open `index.html` in your web browser**.

  * You'll see the webpage with the heading "My Website" and a paragraph.
  * The heading "My Website" will be **steelblue** and centered, confirming that the **CSS is connected**.
  * The paragraph text will say "I've been changed by JavaScript\!", confirming that the **JavaScript is connected**.
  * Finally, open the **Developer Tools** (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac), navigate to the **Console** tab, and you'll see the message **"HTML, CSS, and JS are all connected\!"**. This is a great way to confirm that your JavaScript file is loading correctly.




# 4. Your Best Friend: `console.log()`

`console.log()` is an essential tool for every developer. It allows you to print messages and data to the browser's **Developer Console**, which is a powerful tool for debugging your code.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Check if a file is connected

```javascript
// In app.js
console.log("JavaScript is connected!");
```

Open your `index.html` in the browser, then open the **Developer Tools** (usually by pressing **F12** or right-clicking and selecting **Inspect**), and navigate to the **Console** tab.

If you see your message, your JavaScript is working! âœ…

---

## ðŸ”¹ Inspect variables

```javascript
let user = { name: "Gudisa", age: 20 };
console.log("User data:", user);
```

This lets you view the entire object's contents, making it easy to check if your data is structured as you expect.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Debug DOM selection

```javascript
const heading = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log("The heading element is:", heading);
```

* If this logs `null`, your JavaScript couldnâ€™t find the `<h1>` element (likely because the script ran too early).
* If it logs the element, you know it worked. âœ…

## âœ… Takeaway

Mastering these basics will set you up for success as you start building more complex projects.
Itâ€™s all about:

* Making sure your files are correctly linked
* Using the right tools to **verify your code**
