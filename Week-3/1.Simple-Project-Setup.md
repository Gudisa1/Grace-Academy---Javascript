### 1\. Project Setup

To start, create a new folder for your project and inside it, create three files:

  * `index.html`: This file will contain the structure and content of your webpage.
  * `style.css`: This file will handle the styling and visual presentation.
  * `app.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code for adding dynamic behavior.

### 2\. Connect the Files

Now, let's connect the files together.

#### **HTML and CSS**

To link your CSS file to your HTML document, you'll use a `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file.

**`index.html`**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Connected Files</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>This paragraph will be styled by CSS.</p>

  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **HTML and JavaScript**

To link your JavaScript file, use a `<script>` tag. While you can place it in the `<head>`, the **best practice** is to place it just before the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures that the HTML content is loaded and rendered first, preventing potential errors if your JavaScript tries to manipulate an element that doesn't yet exist in the page.

### 3\. Add Content and Code

Now, let's add some basic content to each file to see the connections in action.

**`style.css`**

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  color: #333;
}

h1 {
  color: steelblue;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**`app.js`**

```javascript
console.log("HTML, CSS, and JS are all connected!");

// Example: Change the paragraph content
const myParagraph = document.querySelector('p');
myParagraph.textContent = "I've been changed by JavaScript!";
```

### 4\. Check in the Browser

To see everything working, simply **open `index.html` in your web browser**.

  * You'll see the webpage with the heading "My Website" and a paragraph.
  * The heading "My Website" will be **steelblue** and centered, confirming that the **CSS is connected**.
  * The paragraph text will say "I've been changed by JavaScript\!", confirming that the **JavaScript is connected**.
  * Finally, open the **Developer Tools** (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac), navigate to the **Console** tab, and you'll see the message **"HTML, CSS, and JS are all connected\!"**. This is a great way to confirm that your JavaScript file is loading correctly.




# 4. Your Best Friend: `console.log()`

`console.log()` is an essential tool for every developer. It allows you to print messages and data to the browser's **Developer Console**, which is a powerful tool for debugging your code.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Check if a file is connected

```javascript
// In app.js
console.log("JavaScript is connected!");
```

Open your `index.html` in the browser, then open the **Developer Tools** (usually by pressing **F12** or right-clicking and selecting **Inspect**), and navigate to the **Console** tab.

If you see your message, your JavaScript is working! âœ…

---

## ðŸ”¹ Inspect variables

```javascript
let user = { name: "Gudisa", age: 20 };
console.log("User data:", user);
```

This lets you view the entire object's contents, making it easy to check if your data is structured as you expect.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Debug DOM selection

```javascript
const heading = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log("The heading element is:", heading);
```

* If this logs `null`, your JavaScript couldnâ€™t find the `<h1>` element (likely because the script ran too early).
* If it logs the element, you know it worked. âœ…

---

## âœ… Takeaway

Mastering these basics will set you up for success as you start building more complex projects.
Itâ€™s all about:

* Making sure your files are correctly linked
* Using the right tools to **verify your code**



## One thing to consider

Placing your JavaScript `<script>` tag at the bottom of the `<body>` is the recommended practice for a few key reasons, primarily to ensure the HTML document has fully loaded before your script tries to interact with its elements.

### The Problem with `<script>` in the `<head>`

When you place a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML, the browser encounters and executes the script **before** it has finished parsing and rendering the rest of the page content (the `<body>`). This can lead to errors, especially when your JavaScript code attempts to select or manipulate an HTML element that hasn't been loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) yet.

Let's look at an example. Imagine you have this HTML:

**`index.html` (with script in head)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Script Placement</title>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello DOM!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

And this JavaScript in `app.js`:

**`app.js`**

```javascript
const heading = document.querySelector("h1");
console.log(heading); // This might log `null`
```

When you open this page, the browser reads the `<head>`, finds the `<script>` tag, and immediately executes `app.js`. At this moment, the `<h1>` element in the `<body>` doesn't exist in the DOM yet. The `document.querySelector("h1")` call will return `null` because the element isn't there, and any subsequent code that tries to use `heading` will fail.

-----

### The Solution: `<script>` at the Bottom of the `<body>`

By moving the `<script>` tag to the end of the `<body>`, you ensure the browser has finished loading and parsing the entire HTML document before executing the JavaScript. This makes all HTML elements available for your script to interact with, preventing common "null" errors.

**`index.html` (with script at bottom)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Script Placement</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello DOM!</h1>

  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

With the script here, the browser first loads the `<h1>` element. Then, it hits the `<script>` tag and runs `app.js`. Now, `document.querySelector("h1")` successfully finds the heading, and your code can work as intended.

This is why it's a standard practice to place your scripts at the bottom of the `<body>`. It's a simple change that ensures your DOM manipulation code runs safely and reliably.
